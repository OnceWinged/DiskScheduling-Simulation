âœ¨ Disk Scheduling Algorithm Simulator
Explore fundamental disk scheduling algorithms (e.g., FCFS, SSTF, SCAN) in a clean and interactive web environment. This project prioritizes simplicity and engaging visuals to help you grasp how these algorithms work.

NOTE:
You had to fill up all fields.
Queue that is larger than 25 requests are not recommended and will have some graphic element dissabled due to some limitation in animating method (This is my first web project ever).
If you have a head that was valid but not listed in the queue, I deemed it nesessary to add it into the simulation.

This is a group project include 3 software engineering students from the Hoasen University, althought I Pham Trung Duc (Milan) work on the website entirely, our subject is more than just a simulation website and include various irl activity that other two members is in charge of.
